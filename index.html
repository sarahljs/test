<h3 style="color: white">My hobbies and interests: </h3>

<p style="color: pink">1 of the things that I love to do is dressing up and taking many photographs. My fashion my not be the best but everyone is unique right? Sometimes I get inspiration from some influencer's instagram pictures and try to recreate them. I would cut and sew my clothes then DIY them so that I can just reuse my old clothes instead of buying new ones to save space and of course MONEY!!</p>
<p style="color: pink">Other than taking pictures, I love doing sports. I play badminton almost every week before the covid situation, swim ones in a while and go cycling every weekends. Even though sports may be tiring at times but it is where all my worries go away. I feel relaxed when I play sports. Fun fact, Im also from the judo cca in SP. I did try to go for dancing and piano classes but I guess Im just not cut out for it. I kinda look like a zombie trying to dance.
</p>

<h3 style="color: white">Reason why Im in DigFab Program: </h3>

<p style="color: pink">I took the Aerospace Electronics course because I took electronics in secondary school and found out that it was quite interesting to me. After that, this elective was offered to me and I think it is a very good opportunity to give me enough experience so that when I enter the outside world, I would have the basic hands on skills and knowledge about engineering. On top of that, I think this elective is a good way to back my resume up if I were to apply to an engineering course in any University.</p>
